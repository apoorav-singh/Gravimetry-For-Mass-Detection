# Deriving Gravity Gradient Tensor from a Single Vertical Gravitational Acceleration

In this study, we explore a methodology to derive the gravity gradient tensor from a single vertical gravitational acceleration measurement. This approach aims to enhance the precision and efficiency of geophysical and geodetic applications. We will delve into the theoretical framework, present the numerical methodology, and discuss the potential implications and applications of this method. The results promise to offer new insights into subsurface structure analysis.

# Documentation
Here is the documentation on the numerical computation program. You can access the TeX files and PDF files in the Documentation directory.

# How it Works
To run the program, you will need Python 3.x installed on your system. After installation, ensure that all dependencies called in the two Python files are met. If any dependencies are missing, the Python interpreter will prompt you to install them. It is recommended that you work in an Anaconda environment. A final word of caution: if you are using the Spyder IDE, ensure you clear all cached variables after making any changes to the parameters to avoid unexpected results.

To start with the code, please go through the documentation to understand the theory and methodology.

To run the code, simply execute the file "ggt_inversion.py". The accompanying file "file_management.py" should be kept in the same directory.

If any parameters need to be changed, they can be adjusted within the "ggt_inversion.py" file.

# STL Plotting
The results can be used to render plots in 3D software such as Blender.
